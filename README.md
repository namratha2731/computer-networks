# Energy-Efficient Scheduling and Power Control in 5G V2X Networks

This repository provides a foundational simulation framework built around SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility), designed to model and analyze traffic dynamics within urban environments. While primarily a mobility simulator, this project serves as a crucial underlying platform for investigating advanced topics such as Energy-Efficient Scheduling and Power Control in future 5G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Networks. By accurately representing realistic vehicular movement and network topology, it creates a robust testbed for developing and evaluating communication and resource management strategies vital for next-generation intelligent transportation systems.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Components

- **Realistic Urban Mobility Modeling**  
  - **OpenStreetMap (OSM) Integration:** Uses `map.osm` to convert real-world road networks into SUMO-compatible format (`map.net.xml`), capturing detailed road infrastructure, intersections, and traffic regulations.
  - **Dynamic Traffic Generation:** Leverages `randomTrips.py` to generate diverse vehicle trips simulating varying densities and origins/destinations (`trips.trips.xml`, `map.rou.xml`).

- **Flexible Traffic Scenarios & Route Management**  
  - Supports primary (`map.rou.xml`) and alternative (`map.rou.alt.xml`) route definitions to simulate route choices and congestion effects.  
  - Enables use of refined or optimized routes (`updated_routes.xml`) for customized scenarios.

- **SUMO Simulation Environment Configuration**  
  - Centralized via `map.sumocfg`, linking network, routes, and simulation parameters (duration, step length, outputs) for reproducibility and flexibility.

- **Python Scripting for External Control & Analysis**  
  - Provides `eng.py` script to interact with SUMO simulations using TraCI or similar APIs for real-time control, data collection, and the injection of custom behaviors ‚Äî essential for testing advanced scheduling and power control algorithms without modifying SUMO internals.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

1. **Install SUMO**  
   Download and install from [https://sumo.dlr.de](https://sumo.dlr.de). Make sure `sumo` and `sumo-gui` executables are added to your system PATH to enable running the simulator and conversion tools.

2. **Install Python**  
   Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

3. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```
   git clone 
   cd computer-networks
   ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Generate SUMO Network  
If `map.net.xml` is missing or should be regenerated from OSM data:  
```
netconvert --osm-files map.osm -o map.net.xml --typemap typemap.xml --output.street-names true --geometry.remove --remove-edges.isolated --keep-edges.by-vclass passenger --keep-edges.by-id -v -x
```
*(Adjust netconvert options as needed for your network specifics.)*

### 2. Generate Traffic Trips  
Use `randomTrips.py` to simulate random trips and create route files:  
```
python randomTrips.py -n map.net.xml -r map.rou.xml -e  -p 
```
Replace `` and `` with your desired values.

### 3. Run the Simulation

- **With GUI (visualization):**  
  ```
  sumo-gui -c map.sumocfg
  ```

- **Without GUI (faster execution):**  
  ```
  sumo -c map.sumocfg
  ```

### 4. Interact via Python (using TraCI or similar)  
To use `eng.py` to control or analyze the simulation:  

- Start SUMO in client/server mode with a remote port:  
  ```
  sumo-gui -c map.sumocfg --remote-port 
  ```

- In another terminal, run the Python script:  
  ```
  python eng.py
  ```
